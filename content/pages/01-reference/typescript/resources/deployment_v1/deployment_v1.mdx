## Deployment V1
Operations that allow you configure and manage an application's [build](https://hathora.dev/docs/concepts/hathora\-entities\#build) at runtime.

### Available Operations

* [Get Deployments](/typescript/deployment_v1/get_deployments) - Returns an array of [deployments](https://hathora.dev/docs/concepts/hathora-entities#deployment) for an [application](https://hathora.dev/docs/concepts/hathora-entities#application).
* [Get Deployment Info](/typescript/deployment_v1/get_deployment_info) - Get details for a [deployment](https://hathora.dev/docs/concepts/hathora-entities#deployment).
* [Create Deployment](/typescript/deployment_v1/create_deployment) - Create a new [deployment](https://hathora.dev/docs/concepts/hathora-entities#deployment). Creating a new deployment means all new rooms created will use the latest deployment configuration, but existing games in progress will not be affected.
