Creates a new [build](https://hathora.dev/docs/concepts/hathora-entities#build). Responds with a `buildId` that you must pass to [`RunBuild()`](https://hathora.dev/api#tag/BuildV1/operation/RunBuild) to build the game server artifact. You can optionally pass in a `buildTag` to associate an external version with a build.
