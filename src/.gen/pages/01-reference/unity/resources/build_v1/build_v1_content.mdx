## Build V1
Operations that allow you create and manage your [builds](https://hathora.dev/docs/concepts/hathora\-entities\#build).

### Available Operations

* [Create Build](/unity/build_v1/create_build) - Creates a new [build](https://hathora.dev/docs/concepts/hathora-entities#build). Responds with a `buildId` that you must pass to [`RunBuild()`](https://hathora.dev/api#tag/BuildV1/operation/RunBuild) to build the game server artifact. You can optionally pass in a `buildTag` to associate an external version with a build.
* [Delete Build](/unity/build_v1/delete_build) - Delete a [build](https://hathora.dev/docs/concepts/hathora-entities#build). All associated metadata is deleted.
* [Get Build Info](/unity/build_v1/get_build_info) - Get details for a [build](https://hathora.dev/docs/concepts/hathora-entities#build).
* [Get Builds](/unity/build_v1/get_builds) - Returns an array of [builds](https://hathora.dev/docs/concepts/hathora-entities#build) for an [application](https://hathora.dev/docs/concepts/hathora-entities#application).
* [Run Build](/unity/build_v1/run_build) - Builds a game server artifact from a tarball you provide. Pass in the `buildId` generated from [`CreateBuild()`](https://hathora.dev/api#tag/BuildV1/operation/CreateBuild).
